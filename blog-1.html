                        When working as an escort your safety always comes first. And when we say safety, we mean both physical and emotional
                        safety, and you can accomplish that only by setting up the right boundaries between you as an escort and your clients.
                        We all know, or at least should know, about how to maintain our physical safety when it comes to dealing with a client,
                        starting with a proper screening, and continuing with meeting him in a familiar place, communicating the details of our
                        encounter to a friend (time, place and so on), staying away from alcohol, keeping the details of our personal life
                        private, having a different escort persona – escort name, special escort phone, a story created to fit our personality.
                        But when it comes to emotional safety, this is where things tend to get more complicated, especially when we don’t have
                        a good example of healthy emotional interactions in our personal life.
                        But knowing how to set emotional boundaries is vital for our wellbeing, especially when working as an escort, a “job”
                        that requires a lot of human interaction that is energy draining
                        
                        Each with his emotions
                        
                        Try not to let yourself be influenced by the way your date is feeling. If he is sad, angry, overly excited, try not to
                        copy his behavior and let yourself be influenced by it, instead try to remind yourself that what he’s feeling is not
                        what you are feeling, and his emotions have nothing to do with you. Try not to take on his negative emotions.
                        
                        Your needs come first
                        
                        If you feel too drained, or you just feel like taking some time to yourself, put your needs first. Try to postpone your
                        next date or refuse to prolong the date by an extra hour if your date is asking you to but you simply don’t feel like
                        doing so. Refuse that extra drink, say a clear “no” when something is making you feel uncomfortable. Even if you will
                        end up losing a client, you will gain something more – your emotional health!
                        
                        Your time is your own
                        
                        You don’t owe anyone anything, so be clear with your time commitment. If you have a no bookings on the weekend policy,
                        or no bookings after 8 pm, make this a rule no matter how much a client may insist on you to change it. Your time is
                        precious, so do not allow anyone to take advantage of your free time or use your time for freebies.
                        
                        Their emotions are not your responsibility
                        
                        The way your dates are feeling is not your responsibility, keep that in mind and do not let yourself be influenced by
                        it. You are not anyone’s mother, girlfriend, or wife, you are not here for anyone to dump their negativity or bad
                        emotions, and you are not obligated to accept their emotional burden. Remind yourself what your role is as an escort and
                        stick to it. You can make small talk, listen to their problems, but don’t make this your job. Protect your own emotional
                        integrity by setting up clear boundaries and by making them clear for everyone to know.
                        
                        Have a life outside escorting
                        
                        Being an escort is a job, keep that in mind! Focus on creating a rich personal life for yourself, a life that fulfills
                        your needs and makes you find peace and tranquility. Create a clear boundary between your escort life and your personal
                        life and try not to accept calls from clients or think about work during your personal time. This time must be dedicated
                        to your own needs, your pleasures, and hobbies. This way you can be fully charged and invested during your dates with
                        your clients.  
                        When talking about emotional boundaries you must think of all the things that are making you feel emotionally
                        uncomfortable and set some rules according to that. Do not treat your emotional safety lightly because when mentally you
                        are not feeling ok, your daily life suffers.
