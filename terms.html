                <h3>Prohibition of Non-Consensual Activities</h3>
                <p>Any form of non-consensual activity, particularly acts of rape, is strictly prohibited. All
                    interactions must be consensual, respectful, and mutually agreed upon by all parties involved.
                    Violation of this rule will result in immediate termination of services and potential legal
                    action.</p>
                <h3>Consent for Group Activities</h3>
                <p>Any form of group activity must receive explicit consent from the individual involved. This
                    ensures that all parties are fully aware and agreeable to the arrangement. Prior consent is
                    mandatory and non-negotiable. Failure to obtain proper consent will result in the cessation of
                    services and possible legal consequences.</p>
                <h3>Zero Tolerance for Sexual Harassment</h3>
                <p>We maintain a strict zero-tolerance policy for any form of sexual harassment or conduct that may
                    cause embarrassment to our escorts. This includes, but is not limited to, unwanted advances,
                    derogatory comments, and inappropriate behavior. Clients are expected to maintain a respectful
                    and professional demeanor at all times.</p>
                <h3>Personal Hygiene Standards</h3>
                <p>Clients are required to adhere to our escort's personal hygiene standards. This includes
                    maintaining cleanliness and grooming to ensure a comfortable and enjoyable experience for all
                    parties involved. Failure to meet these standards may result in the refusal of services.</p>
                <h3>Prohibition of Assault and Molestation</h3>
                <p>Under no circumstances will any form of assault or molestation be tolerated. Our escorts are
                    entitled to a safe and respectful environment. Any breach of this rule will result in immediate
                    termination of the engagement and potential legal action.</p>
                <h3>Consent for Kink and Fetish Exploration</h3>
                <p>The exploration of any kink or fetish is permissible only with the explicit consent of the
                    involved party. Clear and enthusiastic consent must be obtained prior to engaging in any such
                    activities. This ensures that all interactions are consensual, safe, and enjoyable for everyone
                    involved.</p>
                <h3>Enforcement and Consequences</h3>
                <p>Violations of these terms and conditions will result in immediate action, including but not
                    limited to termination of services, banning from future engagements, and legal action if
                    necessary. We are committed to providing a safe, respectful, and enjoyable experience for both
                    our clients and escorts.</p>
                <h3>Agreement</h3>

                    agreement is designed to protect the well-being and rights of all parties involved, ensuring a
                    professional and respectful environment.</p>
